# Welcome

- Welcome to the Julia workshop for Data Science!
- The goal for the workshop is to highlight the main features that make Julia an attractive option for data science programmers
- The workshop is intended for any data scientist with experience in R and/or python who is interested in learning the attractive features of Julia for Data Science. No knowledge of Julia is required.
- Workshop materials in the github repository [julia-workshop](https://github.com/crsl4/julia-workshop)

## Learning Objectives for Tutorial

At the end of the tutorial, participants will be able to:

- Identify the main features that make Julia an attractive language for Data Science
- Set up a Julia environment to run their data analysis
- Efficiently handle datasets (even across different languages) through Tables.jl and Arrow.jl
- Fit (generalized) linear mixed models with MixedModels.jl
- Communicate across languages (Julia, R, python)

Intended audience and level:
The tutorial is intended for any data scientist with experience in R and/or python who is interested in learning the attractive features of Julia for Data Science. No knowledge of Julia is required.

# In preparation for the workshop

Participants are required to follow the next steps before the day of the workshop:

1. Git clone the workshop repository: `git clone https://github.com/crsl4/julia-workshop.git`

2. Install Julia. The recommended option is to use [JuliaUp](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup):

- Windows: `winget install julia -s msstore`

- Mac and Linux: `curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh`

- Homebrew users: `brew install juliaup`

After JuliaUp is installed, you can install different Julia versions with:
```shell
juliaup add release  ## installs release version
juliaup add rc       ## installs release candidate version
juliaup st           ## status of julia versions installed
juliaup default rc   ## make release candidate version the default
```

3. Choose a dataset along with a script to analyze it written in another language (R or python) as we will spend part of the workshop translating participants' scripts to Julia.
